# Instrument to Instrument Translation for Solar Observations

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/iti-documentation/badge/?version=latest)](https://iti-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

The constant improvement of astronomical instrumentation provides the foundation for scientific discoveries. In general, these improvements have only implications forward in time, while previous observations do not profit from this trend. In solar physics, the study of long-term evolution typically exceeds the lifetime of single instruments and data driven approaches are strongly limited in terms of coherent long-term data samples.

We demonstrate that the available data sets can directly profit from the most recent instrumental improvements and provide a so far unused resource to foster novel research and accelerate data driven studies.

`ITI` (Instrument-to-Instrument) is a method that translates between image domains of different instruments, in order to inter-calibrate data sets, enhance physically relevant features which are otherwise beyond the diffraction limit of the telescope, mitigate atmospheric degradation effects and can estimate observables that are not covered by the instrument.

We demonstrate that our method can provide unified long-term data sets at the highest quality, by applying it to ground- and space-based solar observations.

## Installation
To install the `ITI` tool we recommend to use the [installation](https://iti-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/index.html) guide provided in the documentation.

## Usage
We provide an [example gallery](https://iti-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/gallery/index.html) that can be used as a starting point. A complete notebook with all the example steps (download &rarr; preprocessing &rarr; translation &rarr; visualization) can be found in the ``examples`` folder.

## Information
For more information and a detailed description about the `ITI` tool please visit the [documentation](https://iti-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) page.
